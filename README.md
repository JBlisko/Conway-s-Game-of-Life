# Conway's Game of Life
This repo gives a C++ implementation of John H. Conway's 'Game of Life', which is a very basic model of cellular automata. These are discrete models for the propogation of information through the creation and annihilation of cells.

This solution utilizes vectors $v_x$ and $v_y$ containing the coordinates of all alive cells, drastically reducing the memory needed for allocation. Although the grid frame is fixed, the use of vectors allow for a grid size on the bounds $v_x,v_y\in(-1,073,741,823, 1,073,741,823)$, since the largest integer allowed to be stored in an integer vector is $2^{31}-1$. We can square this upper bound by creating another vector to describe how many times the vector has passed through this periodic boundary condition. However, becuase we are limited by a speed of information propogation of at most one cell per time step which we call the 'speed of light' of the grid, we would need at least $1,073,741,823$ time steps to reach this boundary.
